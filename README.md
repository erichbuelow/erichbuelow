# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Erich Buelow, and I'm a Full Stack Developer living near Madison, WI.

As a self-taught developer, I have a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly applications. My primary expertise lies in web development, especially with Vue.js. However, my experience extends to a variety of software solutions, including iOS applications, web apps, internal tools, and Chrome extensions.

My background as a Desktop Support Technician has enabled me to work closely with a diverse range of users, including executive staff of the Wisconsin government. This role has strengthened my ability to communicate effectively with people from all walks of life, a skill that I find invaluable in my development work.

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to collaborate. If you have any interesting projects or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
